FOSSIL CLEANING SYSTEM - SETUP GUIDE
=====================================

This guide will help you set up the fossil cleaning minigame in your Unity project.

SCRIPTS CREATED:
---------------
1. Fossil.cs - Handles world fossils and interaction
2. FossilCleaningGame.cs - Manages the cleaning UI minigame
3. DirtCircle.cs - Individual dirt particles that can be removed
4. FossilSpawner.cs - Spawns fossils in the world

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
==================

PART 1: CREATE THE UI CANVAS
-----------------------------
1. Create a Canvas in your scene (GameObject > UI > Canvas)
   - Set Canvas Scaler to "Scale With Screen Size"
   - Reference Resolution: 1920x1080

2. Create the Cleaning Panel:
   - Right-click Canvas > UI > Panel
   - Rename to "CleaningPanel"
   - Set anchor to stretch (hold Alt+Shift and click the bottom-right anchor preset)
   - Set color to semi-transparent black (e.g., RGBA: 0, 0, 0, 200)

3. Inside CleaningPanel, create the Fossil Image:
   - Right-click CleaningPanel > UI > Image
   - Rename to "FossilImage"
   - Center it (anchor preset: center)
   - Set size to about 400x400
   - This will display the fossil sprite

4. Inside CleaningPanel, create Dirt Container:
   - Right-click CleaningPanel > UI > Empty (or Panel with no background)
   - Rename to "DirtContainer"
   - Set anchor to center and position over FossilImage
   - Same size as FossilImage (400x400)
   - This will hold all the dirt circles

5. Add FossilCleaningGame script to CleaningPanel:
   - Select CleaningPanel
   - Add Component > FossilCleaningGame
   - Assign references:
     * Cleaning Panel: CleaningPanel itself
     * Fossil Image: The FossilImage you created
     * Dirt Container: The DirtContainer you created
   - Configure dirt settings:
     * Dirt Circle Size: 50
     * Dirt Color: Brown (R:0.4, G:0.25, B:0.1, A:1)

6. Disable CleaningPanel by default (uncheck at top of inspector)

PART 2: CREATE FOSSIL PREFAB
-----------------------------
1. Create a 3D object for the fossil:
   - GameObject > 3D Object > Cube (or use a custom model)
   - Rename to "Fossil"
   - Scale it down (e.g., 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)

2. Add a Collider (should have one by default)
   - Make sure it has a Collider component

3. Add the Fossil script:
   - Add Component > Fossil
   - Configure settings:
     * Interaction Radius: 3 (player must be within 3 units)
     * Player Layer: Default (or your player layer)
     * Cleaning Game UI: Drag your CleaningPanel here
     * Fossil Sprite: Add a sprite of a fossil (create/import one)
     * Dirt Particle Count: 15 (how many dirt circles to clean)

4. Make it a prefab:
   - Drag the Fossil object into your Assets/FossilGame folder
   - Delete from scene (we'll spawn them dynamically)

PART 3: PREPARE YOUR FOSSIL SPRITE
----------------------------------
1. Import a fossil image:
   - Add a fossil image to your project (PNG recommended)
   - Set Texture Type to "Sprite (2D and UI)"
   - Apply

2. Optionally create a circle sprite for dirt:
   - You can use Unity's built-in circle
   - Or import/create your own brown circle sprite

PART 4: SETUP FOSSIL SPAWNER
----------------------------
1. Create empty GameObject in scene:
   - GameObject > Create Empty
   - Rename to "FossilSpawner"
   - Position at center of your spawn area

2. Add FossilSpawner script:
   - Add Component > FossilSpawner
   - Configure:
     * Fossil Prefab: Drag your Fossil prefab here
     * Number Of Fossils: 5 (or however many you want)
     * Spawn Area Size: 50, 50 (X and Z range)
     * Spawn Height: 0.5 (height above ground)
     * Ground Layer: Select your ground layer
     * Spawn On Start: checked

PART 5: SETUP PLAYER TAG
------------------------
1. Select your player object
2. In Inspector, set Tag to "Player" (create if needed)
3. Make sure player has PlayerController script

PART 6: TESTING
--------------
1. Play the scene
2. Fossils should spawn around the FossilSpawner
3. Walk near a fossil (within interaction radius)
4. Click on the fossil
5. Cleaning UI should appear
6. Click and drag the brown circles to remove them
7. They should fly off satisfyingly
8. When all are removed, UI closes and you can move again

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
=====================

Fossil.cs:
- interactionRadius: How close player needs to be
- dirtParticleCount: How many dirt circles to clean

FossilCleaningGame.cs:
- dirtCircleSize: Size of each dirt circle
- dirtColor: Color of the dirt

DirtCircle.cs:
- flyOffSpeed: How fast circles fly away
- flyOffDuration: How long the animation lasts
- rotationSpeed: How fast circles spin while flying
- scaleSpeed: How fast circles shrink

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

Issue: Can't click on fossil
Solution: Make sure fossil has a Collider and player tag is set correctly

Issue: UI doesn't show up
Solution: Make sure CleaningPanel reference is assigned in Fossil script

Issue: Player can still move during minigame
Solution: Make sure PlayerController script name matches exactly

Issue: Dirt circles don't appear
Solution: Check that DirtContainer is assigned and visible

Issue: Nothing happens when clicking dirt
Solution: Make sure Canvas has GraphicRaycaster component

ADDITIONAL FEATURES TO ADD:
===========================
- Add sound effects for clicking and removing dirt
- Add particle effects when dirt is removed
- Add a progress bar showing how much is cleaned
- Add different fossil types with different sprites
- Add rewards/points for cleaning fossils
- Add a timer or score system
- Make fossils glow or pulse when in range
